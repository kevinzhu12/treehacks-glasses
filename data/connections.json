Chrome does not support 2D matrices for WebGPU, while Safari does. This discrepancy is causing compatibility issues.\n\n**11:00 AM:** Need to investigate the caching benefits and potential solutions for the matrix support issue. Considering alternatives to ensure cross-browser compatibility.\n\n**12:00 PM:** Discussed the issue with the team. The caching benefits in Safari are significant, especially for storing 2D matrices. However, Chrome's lack of support is problematic. Need to explore why the model file needs to be downloaded and how to optimize this process.\n\n**1:00 PM:** Realized that the model file is quite large (40 MB), which might be causing performance issues. Need to find a way to reduce the file size or optimize the download process.\n\n**2:00 PM:** Adding real-time diffusion features to the website. The problem persists with Chrome not supporting 2D matrices for WebGPU. The caching benefits in Safari are much better, but the model file download is still a concern. The model file runs at around 15-16 diffusion frames, which is acceptable but needs optimization.\n\n**3:00 PM:** Revisited the real-time diffusion feature and discussed optimization strategies with the team. The caching benefits in Safari are still superior, but the model file download remains a bottleneck. Considering alternative approaches to handle the 40 MB model file efficiently.\n\n**4:00 PM:** Tested the real-time diffusion feature across different browsers. The feature works well in Safari but faces issues in Chrome due to the lack of 2D matrix support. Need to find a workaround for Chrome compatibility.\n\n**5:00 PM:** Explored potential solutions for reducing the model file size. Compression techniques and optimizing the download process are being considered. The goal is to improve performance and ensure a smoother user experience across all browsers.\n\n**6:00 PM:** Continued adding real-time diffusion features to the website. The issue with Chrome not supporting 2D matrices for WebGPU persists. The caching benefits in Safari are significant, but the need to download the 40 MB model file is a concern. The feature runs at around 15-16 diffusion frames, which is acceptable but requires optimization.\n\n**7:00 PM:** Discussed the real-time diffusion feature with a colleague. Emphasized the need to optimize the model file download process and ensure cross-browser compatibility. The feature is a favorite and adding it to the website is a priority.\n\n**8:00 PM:** Reflected on personal life. Discussed dating advice and personal relationships. Considered the importance of communication and emotional well-being.\n\n**9:00 PM:** Had a conversation about dating and relationships. Mentioned receiving amazing dating advice over the summer. Reflected on a recent date and the mixed signals received.\n\n**10:00 PM:** Discussed the fear and anxiety associated with asking someone out. Reflected on the complexity of relationships and the importance of clear communication.\n\n**11:00 PM:** Additional reflection on personal relationships and the challenges of asking someone out. Emphasized the fear and anxiety associated with it.\n\n**12:00 AM:** Spent time troubleshooting the diffusion model. The activation function used was causing convergence issues. The issue was traced back to a constant in the CUDA kernel being slightly off, which affected the entire model's performance.\n\n**1:00 AM:** Further discussed the importance of the real-time diffusion feature and the need for optimization. The feature is a favorite and adding it to the website is a priority.\n\n**2:00 AM:** Reflected on personal life and the desire for a girlfriend. Discussed the fear and anxiety associated with asking someone out and the complexity of relationships.",
