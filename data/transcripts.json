  "1739690634185: OK。",
  "1739690640851: Ohh。this is give me join snippets it's in create graphs and yeah actually it's like surprisingly effective。",
  "1739690649559: Wait。how could this possibly be？",
  "1739690661902: Wait，but we use joints if it's not only in this awesome build wrong。",
  "1739690667448: OK，let's try it again。",
  "1739690672547: Is there any issues anymore？Hello，Hello。ohh。",
  "1739690680718: Yo，yo，yo，yo，yo。",

  "1739690755195: Did you clean the graph？no，I didn't clean it OK well that's why we can't parse it right is it wait？but I thought that cleaning was only because there was those are called markdown，yeah，but you have to Run like you still have to no no no cleaning is because the level will never output like the LM is meant output like a chat window right。",
  "1739690759079: Yeah。so what we have to do is。",
  "1739690769218: Then that's a clean JSON，yeah。",
  "1739690777081: I see OK，let's try again。",
  "1739690805072: Unexpected token gates。",
  "1739690813169: No，this is good，you know，this is the output。",
  "1739690816967: JSON。",
  "1739690855449: Currently it's doing that wait and then just like don't show that like，why would the problem is like what we think about it？we don't know what we need to show。the new connections are being formed，right？well，I think it'd be a little cool to show that like a new，notice，OK，wait，wait，wait，but what was up with that？wait，what was even wrong？",
  "1739690862704: 你好，trying to build the grass like each time with each no，right？yeah，like build new connection，yeah。",
  "1739690884276: She just builds one grab the first time，and then every time there's a new Note，add it。but these are all existing notes so there's Nothing to connect to it。wait，wait，what do you mean these are existing though，so there's Nothing to connect to like we are only talking in the new Note，right？no we're plugging in everything there's no graph we connect to we need the initial graph wait we do have the initial graph it's present。",
  "1739690900992: Ohh。wait，I know，but theoretically like this message should work，right？",
  "1739690903798: We know we should also be taking this stuff in，right？",
  "1739690929711: Yeah，I know，but this is what we write into notes that Jason，every single time this should have everything。",
  "1739690936396: No mean JSON is just for the current，notice it。yeah，it is what I'm doing？",
  "1739690939792: Wait I'm pretty sure it's not no wait II wrote this thing I know，Queen。",
  "1739690947313: Wait，but I thought that we have。",
  "1739690954372: Wait I'm pretty wait，but then why are we feeding in the existing existing notes done。",
  "1739690967271: Like part of the notes？yeah，not，though not。ohh，not all every Note，OKOKOKOK，so there's Nothing for it to actually I see there's like Nothing that's why there's only two edges wait that's that's correct？",
  "1739690980192: Ohh。yeah，yeah，I know you mean，wait，wait，wait，it's supposed to take in the old grass as well。",
  "1739690983561: There is no old grass taking like this or at least it should be Nothing，right？",
  "1739690997191: OK，we try generating like a fake one for now and then，like wait theoretically then you think it should be able to like，create connections no。",
  "1739691000426: You still have to modify the wet。",
  "1739691004172: Let's see wait。",
  "1739691005871: Or wait。it's been long ago。",

  "1739691063265: Yeah。",
  "1739691064968: Not very much。",
  "1739691076032: Let me let me like let's shock the shots the progress that's crazy look I'm I'm actually no response to the street hacks use。",
  "1739691083107: I love money。",
  "1739691090898: OK，but I do not remember everything。",
  "1739691096421: Just do，like，wait，wait。",
  "1739691098993: A response。",
  "1739691133272: Ohh。the notes that are getting written in are wrong。",
  "1739691141472: Yeah，we can wait it'll be fine，and we can copy it in。wait。let me just check something though。",
  "1739691144797: What is this？no。",
  "1739691147986: Huh。",
  "1739691155753: This is the method。this is the method that I asked Kevin to write。",

  "1739691185773: Yeah。like the main page。",
  "1739691192828: Yeah，we can we make the OK let's just change the link color for now。",
  "1739691196663: XNXND，let me try to do that。",
  "1739691213584: It's link link link color。",
  "1739691224262: Did you leave here？no，I don't know。do we have a name for our project？",

  "1739691236697: I don't lie。",
  "1739691252653: A little bit generally？",
  "1739691256925: OK wait。",
  "1739691262929: I need to see what the I wanna like actually get the disconnection thing to work，though I'm like no right now we have glasses。",

  "1739691706754: Make this back display like and I'm a weird way outside。ohh。and what which part is weird？I'll ignore it，we just kind of wanted to be in the background。that's actually on top of it and also the links are not just showing it，but that's like whatever。",
  "1739691725027: Yeah，anything of the colors comes it up and go back。yeah，so that shows a link and you click around the corner so it looks like not shit。is there a way to like this？",
  "1739691745020: There's like a certain like threshold like the link right or like you won't draw a link if they're too far apart，right？no it's not it it it draws the link and then it plays the top part but they are based on if it is a link there's no link is yeah those those of all both like。",
  "1739691748891: Yeah，so the issue is not in the middle。",
  "1739691752850: Corner or corner，radiant，right？I don't know that was it。",
  "1739691758696: Wait。the bigger issue we have is that like the model is just like not。",

  "1739691867502: Wait I'll just like show you the issue once he's done with this，we have an issue。",
  "1739691887633: Yeah，because I thought that wait right now we just like generated a synthetic that is or like a big data set from a chatgpt。",
  "1739691906703: Also，you should take me roofing。",
  "1739691913189: A data，right？",

  "1739692072612: 放弃了it's just like we need to debug the model I'll put a little bit。",
  "1739692076578: I think it's worth。",
